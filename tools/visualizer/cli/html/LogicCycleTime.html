        <h1>Cycle time</h1>
<p>The ability to react to chaning conditions as well as the ability to sustain a high due date performance is strongly linked to cycle time.
<code>wait in queue</code> is likewise correlated with cycle time and all else being equal a shorter cycle time will improve performace.
if cycle time increases it's very likely that we can accept substantial decrease in individual performance without impacting the teams performance</p>
<h2>Reading the graph</h2>
<p>If we are improving there will be an downwards trend. The two lines represent a shorter and a longer persepctive.
The trend of the "long" is a stronger signal however if the short has recently changed direction, to the opposite of the long trand, this might be a sign that the long trend will change in the near future</p>
